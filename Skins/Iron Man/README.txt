Thanks for trying out the IronMan/Jarvis Theme Desktop

just want to point out a few things:

- the jarvis display system on the left side contains many "pushable"
  buttons.  
    - for example, you can press the arrow between 'full capacity' and
      'free capacity' to open your primary drive
    - a similar arrow just before the number of waste files opens the
      recycle bin
    - have fun figuring out what button is pushable and for what!

- winamp interface built into the jarvis system has numerous buttons as
  well> play/pause/nxt/prev/fwd/rwnd/volup/voldown/shuffle/repeat

- please point out any and all errors/glitches you face
